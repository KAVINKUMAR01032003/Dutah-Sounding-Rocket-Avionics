<h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2>


A Latch circuit is used in motor firing system to complete the motor's power supply remains the initial trigger signal is removed.
The latch circuit "tiggers" the motor's power supply in the "on" condition.
This is important because motor firing systems is often use short-duration time duration trigger signals to the motor's operation.
Without a latch circuit, the motor's power supply would be cut off as soon as the trigger signal ended. 
The motor will be stop running.It is the flip-flops that store the "on" state of the motor.
When the trigger signal is received the motor's power supply is turned on. 
The flip-flops remain in the "on" state until they are reset by another signal.
So by using the latch circuit in a motor firing systems is more effecient.As they do not need to rely on continuous 
trigger signals to keep the motor running.

<h2>CIRCUIT DIAGRAM</H2>

<h2>WORKING</h2>

The Latch Switch is used in the Motor Firing system of the Rocket. It is used to turn ON and OFF the Motor in the Firing System.  The above circuit works as a toggle switch. It only has two states High (ON) and Low (OFF). 
This device will remain ON unless the Push Button is pushed to reset and similarly it will remain OFF unless the Push Button is pushed again.  It works like a Flip Flop.
This circuit is made up of 555 Timer IC which will help to keep it ON and the Push Button is used to change the states.
