Subsystem: Inertial Sensing Unit
Last date of revision: 02-02-2023
Document status: Draft
Authors: Thiruvarulselvan K

Abbreviations:
CPM - Central Processing Module

Purpose of the subsystem:
Measure the essential parameters of the rocket and communicate with the CPM 

Type	

Requirement	Priority
(Functional, Technical, Operational)		(Core, Essential, Desired)
Functional	Measure the rocket kinetic parameter such as Velocity, Acceleration, Attitude (roll, pitch, and yaw), Altitude.	Core
Functional	Measure the Airspeed on the airframe, Vibration on the airframe, Motor temperature, and System Voltage and Current	Core
Functional	Acquire the real-time location of the rocket 	Core
Operational	Measures the parameters in the appropriate range associated with the rocket’s range of capabilities	Essential
Operational	Should provide required signal resolution and sampling rate	Essential
Technical	Should be powered with the CPM’s output power supply	Essential
Technical	Sampling rate of each sensor should be relative to each other to maintain data sync	Desired
Technical	The sensing units should withstand the effect of changes in the physical parameters during the entire mission	Desired
